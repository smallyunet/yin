# Roadmap

The project is being stabilized before new language features are designed.

## 0.1 — reproducible baseline

- Java 17 build and Maven Wrapper
- JUnit integration suite for maintained examples
- GitHub Actions verification
- consistent Float and primitive type checking
- safe function and record argument validation
- testable diagnostics without JVM termination inside the language core
- scoped type-checker state and shared built-in registration

## 0.1.1 — correctness hardening

- semantic regression coverage for scope, assignment, closures, arguments,
  records, destructuring, unions, primitives, and parser diagnostics
- runtime errors for unbound names
- type-preserving assignment checks
- duplicate keyword and descriptor rejection
- consistent record inheritance conflicts in interpreter and type checker
- documented definition-time semantics for function and record defaults

## 0.2 — semantic cleanup

- runtime `Value` and static `YinType` hierarchies are separate
- runtime and type-checking environments are statically parameterized
- record constructors, record values, record types, and record value types have
  distinct representations
- primitive runtime implementations and static signatures are separate
- diagnostics expose stable codes and source spans
- unreachable attribute and subscript AST implementations are removed

## 0.3 — language definition

- specify grammar and evaluation order
- specify record inheritance and mutation semantics
- specify type equivalence, unions, subtyping, and inference boundaries
- classify historical programs as supported, migrated, or archived

## Later, only after semantics stabilize

- REPL and formatter
- modules
- bytecode or native compilation
- editor/LSP integration

New syntax should not be added until it has a written rule, interpreter tests,
type-checker tests, and diagnostic tests.
